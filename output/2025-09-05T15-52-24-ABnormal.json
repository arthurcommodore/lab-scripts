                "description": "Najimi Ajimu, or Anshin'in as she prefers to be called, has existed for over 3 trillion years before the universe was even created, and 3,402,193,822,311 years by the time of the series. Unlike Pluses like Kurokami Medaka who see themselves above normals, or Minuses like Misogi Kumagawa who see themselves below normals, Anshin'in belongs to an ideology she calls \"Not Equals\". Anshin'in and the other Not Equal, Hanten Shiranui, do not see themselves as above or below humanity, but rather see humanity as something that cannot begin to be compared with them, thus being \"not equal\" to them.\n\nAnshin'in comes off as cold and calculated, always having the upper hand in any confrontation she appears in. This is due to her absurdly expansive arsenal of abilities. She holds 7,932,135,441,523,222 Abnormalities and 4,925,916,526,110,643 Minuses. This gives her 12,858,051,967,633,865 different skills to use. Her skills are classified into ten categories (Sword, Martial Arts, Magic, Mental, Biological, Boss, Gun, Ninja, Protagonist, and Miscellaneous) and include almost every conceivable power one can have, many with very open-ended limits. One such example \"Alibi Block\", allows Anshin'in to appear wherever she wishes, whether that be to the next rooftop, behind a character, in someone's dreams, or even hell itself should she wish it.\n\nAnshin'in is the chief architect of both the Test Tube Plan and the Flask Plan, which seek to create a perfect human, a seemingly impossible task. Three years before the series, while attending Hakobune Middle School to observe the first human she had expectations for, Misogi Kumagawa, she and Hanten Shiranui were sealed by him through the use of his minus, Book Maker, which strips people of their power and reduces them to Kumagawa's level. While sealed, she had little use of her more fantastical powers, but could still use simple ones such as Alibi Block. She frequently used this to appear in Kumagawa's dreams and mind in order to speak with him. She was able to bargain with Kumagawa to give up his minus in exchange for a new one called \"Hundred Gauntlets\", which he later developed into \"All Fiction\". As Kumagawa began to change for the better due to his defeat at the hands of Kurokami Medaka, the seal which took the form of screws on her body began to vanish, and she transferred into Hakoniwa Academy to continue the Flask Plan.\n\nKurokami Medaka's Successor Arc\n~!Just as the student council learns of the threat that Anshin'in poses, she appears before them and explains that she seeks to restart the Flask Plan that they had just previously shut down. When faced with the prospect of having to fight Medaka, she declines, stating that if the world was a manga, then Medaka would be the main character, in which case Anshin'in would be fated to lose. As such, she simply decides to wait for Medaka to graduate so that she can fulfill her goal unimpeded. The council begins its process to select successors to fight against Anshin'in to prevent her from succeeding, but it is revealed that all of the candidates, and approximately 700 million people in the world, have part of Anshin'in in them. As tensions grow in the student council, Zenkichi Hitoyoshi fights with Medaka and claims that he will defeat her. Seeing this as an impossible task, Anshin'in helps train Zenkichi along with the help of Hanten Shiranui, who creates the skill \"Devil Style\" for him, which nullifies any and all coincidence and plot convenience. In the student council election, Zenkichi is victorious over Medaka, something that Anshin'in considered impossible. For something so impossible to be accomplished so perfectly, the world would have to be a manga. She had never found a problem she could not solve, and needed to confirm if there was anything which was impossible for her to accomplish. If something that seemed impossible really was, then that would confirm to Anshin'in that the life she was living was indeed real. The fact that the impossible was actually possible was proof that she lived in a manga, and this was something that Anshin'in could not accept, and attempted to take her own life. However, she is stopped by Medaka, who considers her perception to be a \"simulated reality\", and is convinced to try living as a student for some time to get some perspective.!~\n\nJet Black Bride Arc\n~!As the second black wedding ceremony approaches, Medaka seeks out a team sufficiently powerful to defeat her suitors. She chooses Anshin'in along with Kamome Tsurubami, Hanten Shiranui, Hansode Shiranui, and Kumagawa. After arriving at the aircraft carrier, Black, Anshin'in swiftly defeats the doubles of the suitors using six hundred of her skills, allowing the group to move forward to the real suitors. Zenkichi claims that the weakness of the team he calls \"All Jokers\" is that they all do not dodge the first attack. This is utilized by style user Momo Momozono, who traps everyone except Medaka in cards. Anshin'in idles about for some time, but then decides to break out after enjoying some of the seal a bit more. Medaka bargains for the release of Anshin'in and Hanten, and Anshin'in readies to defeat the rest of the suitors, but is stopped by Medaka so that she can play their game.!~\n\nUnknown Shiranui Arc\n~!Anshin'in, along with Medaka, Kumagawa, and Zenkichi, travel to the Shiranui village to search out Hansode Shiranui after she asks Kumagawa to erase her enrollment at Hakoniwa Academy. Whilst there, the group is ambushed by Iihiko Shishime, Anshin'in's enemy of over five thousand years previously whom she could not defeat after over 100 million attempts. Anshin'in tells the others to escape while she holds Iihiko off, where she fights to the death for the first time. She is cut in half by a Iihiko, and presumed dead by her double, Hanten. She meets with Kumagawa in his mind once more in what she claims is an automated message should she die and returns Kumagawa's Hundred Gauntlets which allowed him to use All Fiction again, as well as a new skill known as Unskilled. As Zenkichi prepares to have a final showdown with Iihiko, Anshin'in is one of the voices to call out to him, and then speaks directly to him to encourage him.!~\n\n~!Anshin'in's message for Kurokami Medaka for the 100 flowers run is a request to play again, affirming in Medaka's and Zenkichi's minds that she is still alive, as she would not make a promise she could not keep.!~",

He has absorbed all the negative aspects of the people he met, failing at everything and losing to everyone at everything. Medaka attempted to reform him, like she had done to her other classmates, but Kumagawa proved to be beyond her influence. Medaka described him as a compulsive liar who places no meaning in trust or doubt. As a negative person by nature, who could kill a person just as easily as he could breathe, Kumagawa thinks nothing of the lives of the people around him and could easily take them away. Despite the immensely negative personality he possesses, he has a purely positive outlook regarding himself and is always seen smiling. As a child, he was tested for abnormalities, but was believed to be normal.  His minus, \"All Fiction\", allows him to erase the existence of things; this includes things with or without form, injuries, his own \"aura\" and other minuses, as shown when he tried to make Emukae's minus become nothing. \n\n~!Chapter 71 was the first time he expressed a emotion, which was anger (Most of the minus are usually emotionless). As stated by Medaka, he actually does care for his comrades. Later he traded \"All Fiction\" for his original minus, \"Book Maker\", which allows him to turn the target into a minus. This was proven in his battle against Medaka. After he admitted his own defeat, Kumagawa was given the Student Council Vice-president position by Medaka, which in turn, made him the final member of the Student Council.!~   \n\n~!Ten years later, Kumagawa's whereabouts are unknown. His message to Medaka from the 100 Flowers Run is revealed to be that he had fun the past four years.!~\n\n(Source: Medaka Box Wiki)",

She became Hakoniwa Academy's Student President as she managed to get 98% of the student body's support. One of her pledges during her campaign was to set up a suggestion box (which later became known as the Medaka Box), along with her childhood friend Zenkichi, goes out to solve any and all problems that comes through.   She is very confident and isn't ashamed of any part of her body at all. She is extremely intelligent and can understand all her subjects well. She has a positive outlook on everyone and everything surrounding her. Medaka sees it as her job to enhance the national prestige. Medaka is capable of learning Abnormalities and completely mastering them, to the extent that she can use them to one hundred and twenty percent of their capability, becoming more skilled with them than even their original owners. This ability allows her to learn any skill quickly, from simple skills like baseball to the impossible feats performed by the members of the Thirteen Part. However, The End does have its limits; Medaka cannot learn skills that exceed her physical limits, and she is unable to stop herself from learning an Abnormality when she experiences it. She is also unable to learn styles   \n\n~!Ten years later, on the anniversary of Ajimu's disappearance, Medaka calls her friends to a reunion at Hakoniwa Academy. She leaves a message for Zenkichi, telling him to meet her in her office once everyone arrives.When Zenkichi comes, Medaka is sleeping on the floor, surrounded by dogs. Waking, Medaka greets Zenkichi.The dogs begin clambering over her, which Medaka finds funny. It is revealed that The End, and all the skills Medaka learned with it, have faded away. After freeing herself from the dogs, Medaka explains to Zenkichi that she has finished her \"Moonsault Plan\", a project to restore the moon. She explains she wants children born after the moon's destruction to see it, as well as both Ajimu and Kumagawa, so that they know she is still well. She reassures Zenkichi that both are alive, and shows him their messages from the 100 Flowers Run. Medaka explains that she has kept all the messages over the past ten years, storing them in the suggestion box. After she admits that the reconstruction of the moon will take several years, Zenkichi challenges Medaka to a duel, with the condition that she marry him if he wins. Medaka is delighted, and accepts, telling him that if she wins, he will have to marry her. Medaka charges Zenkichi, promising that she will never say goodbye to him again.!~",

Though she values the rules, she knows not to go overboard as she threatened to attack Myouri Unzen if he attacked Medaka Kurokami just because he didn't like her.  Her motto is \"Rule with an iron rod.\"  (Source: Medaka Box Wiki)",

Because she does not hesitate to cheat outside of official matches, Nabeshima is known as the \"Queen of Fouls\" in judo. She despises natural geniuses, such as Akune, and has an interest in Zenkichi, wanting him to join the judo club and succeed her as the team's captain. While her devised plot to rid the judo club of Akune and simultaneously have Zenkichi join the judo club fails, she still arranges for Medaka to accept Akune as the secretary of the Student Council and continues to express an interest in Zenkichi. While she does not like admitting it, Nabeshima recognizes that she and Medaka are friends. She has a tendency to avoid situations where she could lose or get badly hurt, so she is regarded as a coward, and is rarely fazed after situations where others are emotionally and mentally scarred.   ~!Ten years later, Nabeshima won a gold medal at the Olympics, despite snapping the ligaments in one of her knees. She is now retired, and teaches children in a small judo class. She is working with Aoki Aka towards a possible recovery.!~  (Wikipedia)",
