His eyes are in a light shade of brown and he has a mole under his right eye. Outside he wears a suit with gloves, many times covered with long beige jacket\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHe is seen as rude, inconsiderate or even arrogant person, but he really has a low self-esteem and deeply cares about others. He tries to stay away from people because he doesn't want to hurt anybody with his mysophobia; which is why he blamed himself so much when his boss got hurt in an accident. This traumatic experience and Kurose Riku's help made Shirotani work on his mysophobia. He's currently trying exposure therapy with Kurose's help, who is also a counsellor in a clinic called Shimada Psychosomatics.",

In this section, he is ironically given a partnership with Motoharu Kaburagi. He reminisces the day when he and Kaburagi attended the same department of a journalism company and through Onoe's hard work, Kaburagi seemed to beat him through every section to be published on DASH magazine ergo counting him as his rival. And being partnered with Kaburagi seemed to only thicken his harboring hatred.\n\nAfter partnering with Kaburagi, Onoe is puzzled by Kaburagi's character because he is quite different towards women than when he's working with him. And unlike Kaburagi, Onoe has his dignity and even calls him a liar for using inappropriate tactics to gain information and evidence. Over time, Onoe is gradually willing to know more about Kaburagi and soon realizes that he is much different than he was given the impression. He eventually becomes attracted to Kaburagi and becomes more bashful around him. This stirs up Kaburagi and becomes increasingly attracted to Onoe's honesty. Though Onoe is an honest man, it confuses Kaburagi because he cannot identify whether Onoe is sarcastic or not; as a result he takes everything Onoe says seriously at the start of their intimate relationship because he knows Onoe rarely lies. Onoe is very attracted to Kaburagi and is easily jealous when it comes to him thus being toiled in assumptions whenever a women gets close to Kaburagi.",

At first, Onoe despised Kaburagi because he had caught what-he-thought-was-his-girlfriend hugging Kaburagi in the office. Ironically, he was soon moved into a new section of journalism, working alongside Kaburagi.\n\nHis character is introduced as an attractive, quite popular and cool photographer. Often you may see him smoking whether he's on the job or not (most of the times he smokes when reflecting on something). He attracts attention from women everywhere and anywhere he goes, inevitably redeeming himself a \"womanizer\" status. Despite his appearance, Kaburagi is dedicated and serious about his job. He is steadfast when it comes to capturing evidence on a scoop, even so much as to lend his body and deceive his subjects to gain information. Though he is deceitful and shameless for the sake of his job, Kaburagi identifies that he is \"fake\" but towards Onoe he is honest and blunt. Kaburagi is captivated by Onoe's honesty and often embarrasses Onoe by teasing. And he may not look it, but he can be quite jealous over Onoe (especially when it comes to Onoe \u0026amp; his friend, Masa).\n\nHe has a younger sister named Noriko.",
